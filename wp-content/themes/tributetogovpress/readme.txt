== Description ==

Block theme, inspired by the graphic style of the classic GovPress theme by govfresh (https://wordpress.org/themes/govpress/). This theme has been designed on two easily invertible columns and is editable. Built with the typical functions of a blog in mind, it has an intuitive and pleasant interface. This theme offers nine different filter effects for images and featured images. It also offers an effect that shows or hides the filter as the cursor hovers over the image.
